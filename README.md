Project Description: 
This project aims to enhance the security and compliance posture of an AWS environment by implementing a comprehensive and automated solution for IAM (Identity and Access Management) access key management. It leverages AWS Lambda functions, AWS CloudWatch Events, AWS Secrets Manager, and IAM services to achieve key objectives

Key Components and Workflow: 
- AWS Lambda Functions: Utilizes serverless compute power to automate key rotation processes without the need for manual intervention. 
- CloudWatch EventsBridge: Triggers Lambda functions based on predefined schedules, ensuring timely and consistent key rotation. 
- Secrets Manager: Securely stores and manages IAM access keys, offering centralization of secrets management and facilitating secure retrieval by Lambda functions. 
- IAM: IAM roles and permissions are managed to enable key rotation and removal.

Benefits and Outcomes: 
- Enhanced Security Posture: Automation reduces human error and ensures that keys are rotated and inactive keys are removed promptly, minimizing the attack surface. 
- Compliance Assurance: Adherence to industry and organizational security compliance requirements through consistent and documented key management practices. 
- Operational Efficiency: Reduces manual effort and operational overhead associated with IAM access key management, allowing IT teams to focus on higher-value tasks. 

This project delivers a robust, automated solution for IAM access key management, encompassing both key rotation and the removal of inactive keys. 
By leveraging AWS services and best practices, it enhances security, compliance, and operational efficiency within the AWS environment, safeguarding sensitive resources and reducing operational overhead.
